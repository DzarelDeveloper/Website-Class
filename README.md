## API Documentation

This project does not utilize any external APIs besides CDNs for libraries.  There are no custom APIs to document. The `src/script.js` file fetches data from `https://api.statcord.com/v3/884467910494535741`, but this is unrelated to the class website's core functionality and appears to be for a Discord bot.
